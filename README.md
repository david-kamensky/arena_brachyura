# Arena Brachyura

This is a minimal software-rendered FPS game I wrote as an exercise to try out the internet's "[most admired](https://github.blog/2023-08-30-why-rust-is-the-most-admired-language-among-developers/)" programming language, Rust. It started as a direct port of a smaller "2.5D" game I'd written in college while learning C/C++, but I ended up generalizing it in a number of ways, including 3D mouselook. I also overhauled the art with various crab-like monsters inspired by Rust's unofficial mascot, hence "*Brachyura*" (the scientific name for crabs) in the title.

## How to compile and run

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation), and [SDL2\_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases), clone the repository, `cd` into its root directory, and run `cargo build --release`. (The default debug build is slow to the point of being effectively unplayable, at least on my computer.) The directory `<repository>/target/release/` will contain an executable, `arena_brachyura`. Download an archive of the game data [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sx9hzzt497yiz6mcp3w6y/arena_brachyura_data_7_20_2024.zip?rlkey=wegn0nce782q0ipadcz7namuv&st=thv20x4y&dl=1), unzip it, and move the `data/` directory into the same directory as the executable. The executable can be run from any working directory, as long as it and `data/` are in the same parent directory (i.e., the executable will look for `data/` in its own parent directory). You may need to adjust the SDL version specified by `Cargo.toml` to match the version installed on your system.
